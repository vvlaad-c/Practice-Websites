Practice Websites In HTML, CSS and JS

## New York Attractions 🗽
#### Description
The new york travel blog is a practice website I built to get a better
understanding of html and css. The website is not very conmplex as it
only has a landing page, a navbar and some text and media content

#### Tools used
I used pure CSS to style the website, without any additional frameworks like
bootstrap. I also added a favicon to the website so that it will look more proffesional
The photos which were used are from google and the fonts used are from google fonts
